# Lead Gen System — Design Doc

Last updated: 2026-05-04

## The Advantage Over Everyone Else

Every competitor's system is INBOUND — build a site, hope people come, handle whoever shows up. Our system is OUTBOUND + INBOUND: we find them, research them, personalize the outreach, and when they respond, the AI already knows their business before the call starts.

GHL agencies ask "tell me about your business." Our agent says "I see you run [X] and you posted about [Y] last week — here's what I'd automate for you."

## Architecture

```
OUTBOUND PIPELINE:
  Prospect List → Social Scraping → Enrichment → Personalized DM/Email → Response
    → Qualification → Vapi Demo Call (pre-loaded with prospect context)

INBOUND PIPELINE:
  Site Traffic → Survey Qualification → Demo Consent → Vapi Demo Call
    → Same cascade as outbound
```

## Phase 1: Manual + Claude Code (this week)

### Step 1: Build Prospect List + Multi-Filter Scoring

The pipeline narrows and scores. Each filter produces hard evidence.

**Filter 1 — Businesses in niche + location**
- Source: Google Maps, Yelp, industry directories
- Niche: businesses that take phone calls (dentists, realtors, contractors, restaurants, law firms)
- Tool: Firecrawl scrapes Google Maps by niche + location
- Output: ~500 raw results per niche/location

**Filter 2 — Find the OWNER on social media + they're active**
- Cross-reference business name → LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X
- Active = posted in last 30 days
- Output: ~150 remain (30% have active owners)

**Filter 3 — Evidence of the problem**
Hard evidence they have the pain we solve:
- Reviews say "hard to reach," "never answers the phone," "left a voicemail"
- Website says "leave a message" or has no chat/phone
- Google Business shows "typically responds in 1-2 days" (too slow)
- They posted about hiring a receptionist or being overwhelmed
- Output: ~60 remain

**Filter 4 — Awareness level**
Have they posted ABOUT AI, voice agents, or automation?
- **HOT (aware + no solution):** posted about AI/voice agents, interested but hasn't implemented → ~25
- **WARM (problem visible, unaware of solution):** has the problem but hasn't connected it to AI → ~35

**Filter 5 — Current automation level**
- Already has AI voice agent → skip (or upsell to L3+)
- Has some automation (Zapier, basic chatbot) → mid-tier prospect
- Zero automation → best prospect for first sale

**Lead Score Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. Smith",
  "business": "Smith Family Dental",
  "website": "smithdental.com",
  "owner_social": "instagram.com/drsmith_dds",
  "owner_active": true,
  "last_post": "2026-04-28",
  "score": "HOT",
  "evidence": {
    "problem": ["3 reviews mention 'hard to reach by phone'", "site says 'leave a message'"],
    "awareness": ["posted about 'AI in dentistry' on LinkedIn 2 weeks ago"],
    "current_automation": "none detected",
    "personalization_hooks": [
      "just hired a new hygienist (scaling, busier)",
      "open Saturdays now (more calls, less staff)",
      "3 reviews: patients love you but can't reach you"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Generate Personalized Outreach (scored by lead temperature)

**HOT leads (aware + problem + no solution):**
"Hey [Name], I saw you posted about [AI topic]. I noticed [Business] still routes to voicemail after hours — I built an AI voice agent that handles exactly that. Want to test it free for a month? Call this number right now and hear it: [Vapi demo]"

**WARM leads (problem visible + unaware):**
"Hey [Name], I was looking at [Business] reviews and noticed a few mention trouble reaching you by phone. I built something for exactly that — an AI that answers every call in 60 seconds, qualifies leads, and books appointments. Want to try it free? You can test it right now: [Vapi demo]"

**Referral Bait DM (universal):**
"Hey [Name], I'm hoping you can help me out. I know [Business] takes calls from leads and I'm looking to have a couple businesses test my AI voice agent system for a month for free. Would you be open to trying it? Call the demo line right now to hear it: [Vapi number]"

**Email Template (CAN-SPAM compliant):**
Subject: "[Business] — [specific evidence, e.g. 'your patients can't reach you by phone']"
Body: Personalized referencing specific reviews/posts/evidence from enrichment.
CTA: "Reply 'yes' and I'll set up a 30-second test call"
Footer: Physical address + unsubscribe link (CAN-SPAM required)

### Step 4: Send
- Email: Gmail API or SMTP (start manual, automate later)
- DM: Instagram DM (manual first), LinkedIn InMail (manual first)
- Volume: 50/day email, 20/day DM (warm up accounts)

### Step 5: Response Handling
- "Yes" → send Vapi demo number OR direct to site survey
- "Tell me more" → send one-liner + Vapi number
- "Not interested" → log, move on
- No response → follow-up in 3 days (max 3 touches)

### Step 6: Vapi Call (Pre-Loaded)
When prospect calls the demo number, Vapi agent has their enrichment data:
- "Hi [Name], thanks for calling. I understand [Business] has been dealing with [pain_point]. Let me show you how this would work for your specific situation..."
- Agent demos itself AS their receptionist
- Runs the cascade: close → book Isaac → B2C → nurture

## Phase 2: Automated (week 2+)

### Automation Targets
| Manual Step | Automated Version | Tool |
|-------------|------------------|------|
| Build prospect list | Firecrawl scrapes Google Maps by niche+location | Firecrawl API + cron |
| Enrich prospects | Claude reads scraped data, outputs JSON | Claude API batch |
| Generate messages | Claude generates from enrichment + template | Claude API |
| Send emails | Gmail API or Instantly.ai | API + scheduler |
| Send DMs | PhantomBuster or manual | (manual stays longer — platform risk) |
| Response handling | Classify + route via Claude | Webhook + Claude |
| Follow-up | Scheduled sequences | Cron + email API |

### 3-Agent Pattern (from Stephen Pope)
Instead of one complex agent:
1. **Lead Enrichment Agent** — scrapes + researches + outputs JSON profile
2. **Outreach Agent** — generates personalized DMs/emails from profile
3. **Response Agent** — classifies responses, routes to Vapi or follow-up

Each agent has a SHORT prompt with EXAMPLES not RULES.

### Cross-Platform Session Normalization (from Stephen Pope)
All channels normalize to:
```
{ unique_id, message, platform }
```
Session ID starts as email → graduates to phone once captured → all history rewires.
Conversation never restarts across channels.

### Mid-Call Injection (from Stephen Pope)
When prospect books via Cal.com during Vapi call:
- Cal.com fires webhook
- Webhook calls Vapi control URL
- Injects "You're booked for [date]" into the live call
- Prospect hears confirmation while still on the phone

## Compliance

### CAN-SPAM (Email)
- Must include: physical address, unsubscribe link, honest subject line
- Must honor unsubscribe within 10 business days
- No deceptive headers

### FCC TCPA (Phone/SMS)
- NO outbound AI calling without prior express consent
- Inbound AI + consented callback = legal
- The demo number is INBOUND (they call us)

### Platform TOS (DMs)
- Instagram/LinkedIn have automation limits
- Start manual, automate carefully
- Risk: account suspension if too aggressive
- Mitigation: warm up accounts, personalize (not templates), low volume

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Emails sent/day | 50 |
| DMs sent/day | 20 |
| Open rate | >40% |
| Reply rate | >5% (cold), >15% (warm) |
| Demo calls/week | 10+ |
| Close rate (Vapi) | >10% |
| Cost per acquisition | <$200 |
| Revenue per client | $2K+ setup + $200/mo |
